# About

Alpine Linux is an independent, non-commercial, general purpose Linux
distribution designed for power users who appreciate security, simplicity
and resource efficiency.

## Small

Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller
and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. A
container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk
requires around 130 MB of storage. Not only do you get a fully-fledged
Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository.

Binary packages are thinned out and split, giving you even more control
over what you install, which in turn keeps your environment as small and
efficient as possible.

## Simple

Alpine Linux is a very simple distribution that will try to stay out of
your way. It uses its own package manager called apk, the OpenRC init
system, script driven set-ups and that's it! This provides you with a
simple, crystal-clear Linux environment without all the noise. You can
then add on top of that just the packages you need for your project, so
whether it's building a home PVR, or an iSCSI storage controller, a
wafer-thin mail server container, or a rock-solid embedded switch, nothing
else will get in the way.

## Secure

Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. The kernel is patched with
grsecurity/PaX out of the box, and all userland binaries are compiled as
Position Independent Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection.
These proactive security features prevent exploitation of entire classes
of zero-day and other vulnerabilities.
